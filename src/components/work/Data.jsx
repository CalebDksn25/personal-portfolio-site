      "I created a modern and visually engaging e-commerce website for Nocrate, a streetwear and vintage clothing brand. The site features a minimalist design with a clean homepage and intuitive navigation, allowing users to easily explore shop categories. It includes a custom login and sign-up system with Google and Shopify integration for secure and seamless user authentication. The interactive shop page showcases products on a unique “clothing rack” layout with hover animations that enhance user engagement.
